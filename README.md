# Smart-Eye
A one year project I did in a group for my undergrad back in 2008. The system was developed in .NET 3.5 framework and predicted an object from a stereo image. Unfortunately, the source code has been lost and this presentation is only what I have remaining. Since I worked on this for a year, and put in a lot of effort, I wanted to make this a part of my portfolio.
