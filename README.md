# Smart-Eye
A one year project I did in a group for my undergrad back in 2008. The system was developed in .NET 3.5 framework and predicted an object from a stereo image. I havent maintained this project, but since I worked on this for a year, and put in a lot of effort, I wanted to make this a part of my portfolio.
